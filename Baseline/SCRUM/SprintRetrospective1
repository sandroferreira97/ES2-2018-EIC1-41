1ºSprint 10/03 - 18/03

Positive Points:

- We finished all the daily reunions, and because of that all, members of the group have a good understanding of the project.
- The GUI, having the biggest priority, had great implementation improvements.


Negative Points:

- The GUI was not finished because we had problems understanding certain specifications of the project.
- Another negative point is that the optimization process and the graphics part of the project have almost no implementation. 

to Improve:

- We need to separate better the tasks that every member of the group has to do.
