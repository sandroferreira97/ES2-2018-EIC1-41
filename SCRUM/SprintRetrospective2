2ºSprint 30/04 - 13/05

Positive points:

- The optimization Process is having good improvements
- We improved our organization and did better commits

Negative Points:

- The GUI is constantly being changed to "feed" the JMetal classes meaning that the GUI implementation was not the best.
- We had less time to work on this project because of other college projects that we had to do and to deliver during this sprint.
- There is almost no Graphics 2D implementation.

Points to improve:

- We should improve our trello organization
- Since the next sprint will be the last we need to finish the project so we need to increase our time spent on this project during the next sprint.
